Callback functions are functions that get called in other files.
	Example: In app.js - asynch
		var weather = require('./weather.js');
	links the weather variable to whatever the output of module.exports is in weather.js
	
The module can return anything, including a callback function.
	Example: In weather.js - asynch
		module.exports = function (location, callback) {
			//code to run every time weather is invoked
		} 

The second parameter takes in a callback function and is called in the external file
	callback('It is ' + body.main.temp + 'F in ' + body.name);

The function that gets passed is defined in the app.js - asynch file although the implementation defines the function as an argument.

location(function (location){
		if(location){
			weather(location.city, function(currentWeather){
				console.log('No location given');
				console.log('Location Estimate: ' + location.city);
				console.log(currentWeather);
			});
		} else{
			console.log('No city could be found for the user.');
		}
	});
